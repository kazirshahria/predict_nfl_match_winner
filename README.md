# 🏈 Predict The NFL Matchup Winner 🏈

**Objective**: Develop a machine learning model that can classify the winner of NFL matchups based on historical matchups

## What Problems Does It Solve?

Understanding which team has a higher chance of winning or losing helps fans and stakeholders to:

- Create better decisions
- Gain a competitive advantage
- Potentially profit

## Key Findings

- Model is more accurate at predicting home wins
- Win percentages from previous season increases model's accuracy

## Notes

- Teams may have not faced each other enough for the model to make accurate predictions

## Next Steps

This model only looks at matchup, game information, and win records. 

To better predict the winning team, other factors such as lineups, injury reports, recent performance, and team ranking, may improve predictive capabilities.
