# 🏈 Predict NFL Matchup Winner 🏈

**Objective**: Create a model that is able to predict the winner of matchups in the NFL using historical data and team information

## What Problems Does It Solve?

A team winning or losing can help sport enthusiasts and companies to:

- Make better decisions
- Gain a competitive advantage
- Estimate the probability of winning

## Key Findings

- A team being home or away is not important deciding who wins or loses
- The model performs well predicting home winners
- The XGB model generalizes winning teams better than logistic regression

## Next Steps

This model is **ONLY** looking at matchup, game information, and win percentage from last season. To better predict the winning team, other factors such as lineups, recent performance, and team ranking, may improve predictive capabilities.
